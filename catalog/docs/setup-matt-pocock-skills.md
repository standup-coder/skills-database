# setup-matt-pocock-skills（工程技能仓库初始化）

> 为仓库配置 issue tracker、triage 标签与领域文档布局

## 概述

Configure this repo for the engineering skills — set up its issue tracker, triage label vocabulary, and domain doc layout. Run once before first use of the…

## 使用场景

- Explores the current repo to detect GitHub/GitLab remotes, existing `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`, and domain doc layout before prompting
- Walks through three guided decisions one at a time: issue tracker location (GitHub, GitLab, local markdown, or custom), triage label vocabulary mapping, and domain doc structure (single or multi-context)
- Writes an `## Agent skills` block to the appropriate root file and creates three reference docs under `docs/agents/` that downstream skills (`to-issues`, `triage`, `diagnose`, `tdd`, `improve-codebase-architecture`) will read
- Allows editing of the draft configuration before committing changes; re-running is only needed if switching trackers or restarting from scratch
- Issue tracker — where issues live (GitHub by default; local markdown is also supported out of the box)
- Triage labels — the strings used for the five canonical triage roles

SKILL.md
Scaffold the per-repo configuration that the engineering skills assume:
- Issue tracker — where issues live (GitHub by default; local markdown is also supported out of the box)
- Triage labels — the strings used for the five canonical triage roles
- Domain docs — where `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs live, and the consumer rules for reading them
This is a prompt-driven skill, not a deterministic script. Explore, present what you found, confirm with the user, then write.
Look at the current repo to understand its starting state. Read whatever exists; don't assume:
