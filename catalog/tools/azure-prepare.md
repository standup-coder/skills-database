# azure-prepare（Azure 准备）

> 为 azd 项目生成 azure.yaml、Bicep 等部署前置物

## 概述

Prepare azd-based Azure projects for deployment: generates azure.yaml, infrastructure (Bicep/Terraform), and Dockerfiles for the Azure Developer CLI (azd)…

## 使用场景

- Generates Bicep or Terraform infrastructure code, azure.yaml configuration, and Dockerfiles based on application type and deployment target
- Requires mandatory plan-first workflow: analyze workspace, gather requirements, select recipe (AZD, AZCLI, Bicep, or Terraform), design architecture, then execute only after user approval
- Covers new app creation, modernization, and updates; routes specialized requests (copilot SDK, cloud migration, AI gateway) to dedicated skills before resuming preparation
- Hands off to azure-validate for infrastructure validation and azure-deploy for deployment execution; plan status must be updated to "Ready for Validation" before validation begins
- Create a new application
- Add services or components to an existing app
